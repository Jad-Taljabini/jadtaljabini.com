# jadtaljabini.com

This repository contains the source of my personal website.
The site is built with a single HTML file (`index.html`) and a profile image (`profile.png`).
It showcases my background as a student and developer and includes animated sections written in vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

## Running locally

No build steps are required. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:

```bash
$ git clone <repository-url>
$ cd jadtaljabini.com
$ open index.html  # or use your browser's file-open dialog
```

## Features

- Responsive layout using CSS media queries
- Animated hero section with typing effect
- Interactive cards and timeline
- Contact information and call-to-action buttons

Feel free to fork the project and adapt it for your own website.
